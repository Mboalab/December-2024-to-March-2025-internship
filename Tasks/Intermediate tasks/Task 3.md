# Task 3: AI Model development

## Objective:  

This task's goal is to create and implement a machine learning model that can assess skills/qualifications and suggest jobs, scholarships, internships based on the cleaned and preprocessed data from Task 1. 
Interns will use AI and machine learning techniques to develop a tool that can assess a person's skill set and make recommendations for a personalized job/scholarship/internship etc.

## Skills
Streamlit: Interns will create a user-friendly web application for distributing their model with ease using this open-source framework.
Version control systems, such as Git, are useful tools that interns will use to share their work on GitHub and track changes made to their work.
Machine Learning Algorithms: get familiar with machine learning algorithms
Systems of Recommendations

Good resources to get started with GitHub:
- [Machine learning deployment using streamlit](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/10/machine-learning-model-deployment-using-streamlit/)

_Note that you do not need to be a master in VCS/Git/GitHub to start contributing. 
Once you are comfortable with the basics, you can start contributing to open-source._

## Main activities to complete: 
- Based on the available data and the intended functions, select the best machine learning algorithms.
- Using the preprocessed data, train the selected model or models, iteratively adjusting their parameters to increase accuracy.
- To evaluate the performance of the model and pinpoint areas for development, use pertinent metrics (such as accuracy, precision, and recall)
- A web application that allows users to input their abilities and obtain recommendations from a trained model should be created using Streamlit.
- Using GitHub, share the code used for web application development, model training, and deployment.
- Document.
